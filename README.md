# webdriver-mocha-async-await-example

This is an example of using Mocha, Selenium Webdriver and Babel together to provide async / await syntax to browser automation tests. Additionally, the page objects conventions model how Airware's test automation team structures their tests.

Originally presented at the Selenium Meetup in SF on 10-19-16.

Prequisites include Java, NodeJs, Chrome browser.

To start the Selenium server, run `npm run install` and `npm run start`

To run the acceptance test suite, run `npm test`
